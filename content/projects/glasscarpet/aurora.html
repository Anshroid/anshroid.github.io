        Hi! I’m <b id="name">Aurora</b>, I’m a rock gnome from a tiny village in a place you won’t know. My parents wanted me to follow in their footsteps as tinkers, but I couldn't stand it and collected every book I could find in the town to learn magic instead. You’ll often find me getting distracted by pretty much anything, losing myself in loose pages from one of my many notebooks, or twirling my little brass gear ring nervously. I’m about average height for gnomes (so quite short!) - and the sketch will explain how I look far better than I ever could in words!</p>

        <p class="f4"><b class="f3">What are you doing with the couriers' guild?</b><br>
        There really wasn't much to do or see in my town! I didn't want to stay in that place and tinker on building useless contraptions like everyone else did, so I took the first opportunity I saw to travel the world and learn new things elsewhere. I've been making notes on pretty much anything I can find ever since, it's all so interesting!</p>

        <p class="f4"><b class="f3">Is there anything else you (the player) want to say?</b><br>
        Nope!</p>
